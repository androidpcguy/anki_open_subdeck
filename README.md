# README

This addon allows you to open the subdeck of the current card that you are
reviewing. If you're not reviewing a card, it defaults to the regular browse
function.

## Usage

Press "Browse current deck" under the Tools menu. Or, more conveniently, press
the default keybinding Alt+B.

## Known Bugs

Changing the keybinding to include the Ctrl key makes the browser not to
highlight the current card.
